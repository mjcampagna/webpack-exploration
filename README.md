# Exploring Webpack configuration

Through Webpack lies the path to madness. This I have gathered, reading various articles scattered like breadcrumbs amongst the Interwebs' tangles.

Rather than follow those crumbs, I have decided to cut my own path. My hope is to create a base Webpack configuration, simple and straight-forward, hewing as closely as I can to those modules and plugins maintained by the Webpack Team themselves. In this way, I hope to minimize the wonkiness and hackiness that many articles seem to encourage in their configurations.

At time of writing, Webpack 4.8.3 is current.

This article assumes some familiarity with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm, and with setting up a new project folder or repository.

Initialize the project folder with:

````$ npm init````

It's okay to accept the defaults, and you will end up with a `package.json` ready to work with.
